# Working with HDF4 files in pure Python

The HDF4 file spec is defined in the Specification and Developer's Guide document, from the [HDF4 website](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF4/HDF4).

The eventual goal of this is to understand HDF4 enough to enable HDF4 access via the Zarr library using the [Kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/) approach.

Initial tests are around the MODIS Surface Reflectance L2G product ([NASA EarthData Search link](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=C2202497474-LPCLOUD)).
